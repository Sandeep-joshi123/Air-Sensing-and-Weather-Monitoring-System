# Air Sense & Weather Monitoring System

## Abstract
The Air Sense & Weather Monitoring System is a portable, low-cost, IoT-based
environmental monitoring solution designed to provide **real-time,
point-of-measurement environmental data**. Unlike conventional air quality and
weather monitoring applications that rely on **area-averaged values from
sparsely distributed monitoring stations**, this system captures environmental
parameters **directly at the location of deployment**, enabling accurate
micro-environmental assessment.

The system continuously measures temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure,
altitude, ambient noise levels, and air quality. To ensure measurement
reliability and consistency, the prototype employs **industry-grade
environmental sensors** rather than hobby-grade modules, enabling improved
accuracy, stability, and repeatability suitable for real-world deployments.

Air Quality Index (AQI) values are computed using **government-accepted standard
formulations**

This project was shortlisted among the **Top 17 prototypes out of 150+ submissions**
and secured **8th place** under the *Mentored Student Projects* category at
**IASF 2026 & ICTIEE 2026**, held at GITAM (Deemed to be University), Bengaluru.

## Motivation
Most existing air quality and weather monitoring platforms—including mobile
applications and government-operated monitoring stations—provide
**region-level or area-averaged environmental data**. While suitable for
macro-scale analysis, such data often fails to represent the **actual
environmental conditions experienced at a specific location**, particularly
within indoor environments, traffic-dense zones, industrial areas, and
noise-sensitive regions.

Furthermore, many low-cost monitoring solutions rely on **consumer- or
hobby-grade sensors**, which may suffer from poor accuracy, drift, and limited
long-term reliability.

The Air Sense & Weather Monitoring System addresses these limitations by enabling
**localized, point-of-measurement environmental sensing using industry-grade
sensors**, combined with standardized AQI computation. This approach delivers
accurate, reliable, and context-aware environmental insights for public health
awareness and early risk identification.

## System Overview
The system integrates multiple **industry-grade environmental sensors** with a
microcontroller-based embedded platform. Sensor data is sampled periodically,
processed locally, and displayed in real time on an OLED screen. The processed
data is also transmitted wirelessly to a cloud backend over Wi-Fi, allowing
users to access both real-time and historical environmental data through a
mobile application.

Unlike centralized monitoring stations that depend on spatial interpolation,
this system operates as a **distributed localized sensing node**, enabling
scalable deployment for high-resolution environmental monitoring.

## AQI Calculation Methodology
Air Quality Index values are computed from raw pollutant measurements using
**government-accepted AQI formulations**, ensuring regulatory relevance and
interpretability.

### AQI Standards Followed
- **CPCB (India)** AQI formulation based on sub-index calculation for individual
  pollutants and aggregation using the maximum sub-index approach.
- **AirNow (United States)** AQI methodology aligned with U.S. EPA standards for
  pollutant concentration-to-index mapping.

### AQI Computation Approach
1. Raw pollutant concentration is obtained from the air quality sensor.
2. Individual pollutant sub-indices are computed using breakpoint tables defined
   by CPCB and AirNow standards.
3. The overall AQI is determined using the **maximum sub-index principle**.
4. AQI categories (Good, Satisfactory, Moderate, Poor, etc.) are assigned based
   on standard classification thresholds.

This methodology ensures that AQI values generated by the system are **directly
comparable with official air quality reports and public health advisories**.
